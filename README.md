The (almost) jankiest puppeteer-powered extractors, mainly for Aniwave and its providers (Vidplay/Mycloud/MegaF/Vidstream, they're all the same thing), provided to u by El Nixu
 
Old (jankiest) extractors as well as a key cache can be found @ https://github.com/Nixuge/aniwave_providers/

# Out of service
Aniwave, and as far as i know all of its sister website have officially been shutdown as of the 27/08/2024.

The updated extractor kept working until the very end, and as of right now still is. Unfortunately, links expire, making the keys now useless.

Was pretty funny to fight against Aniwave, first website I actively scraped. Learned how to make a ton of jank things in Javascript to get those keys out. If you need help with web scraping of some sort, you can dm me on telegram or discord, I should be active on there.

#### This repo is now archived, and will remain archived except if Aniwave comes back (w a different identity?) once ACE has calmed down
